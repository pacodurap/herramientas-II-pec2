                    <p>Holy Wave is a band of multi-instrumentalists from El Paso, Texas, USA. Since making a move to
                        Austin in 2008, they have cemented themselves as a unique force in the national and
                        international touring circuit.</p>

                        groove-heavy instrumental space rock that have earned them comparisons to everyone from Can to
                        Stereolab to Funkadelic.</p>

                    <p>One of the most distinctive alternative bands to emerge in the '90s, Stereolab either celebrated
                        forms of music that were on the fringe of rock, or brought attention to strands of pop music
                        that were traditionally banished from the rock lineage. </p>

                    <p>Peter Kember’s music career began with the formation of Spacemen 3, which he co-founded in 1982
                        with Jason Pierce (Spiritualized). As the influential psych-soul band dissolved, Kember then
                        debuted Sonic Boom with 1990’s Spectrum.</p>

                        Corruptible Faces that reflected the claustrophobic life they were leading in the big cities of
                        Guadalajara and Mexico City</p>
