                    <p>Originating in the mid-1960s among British and American musicians, the sound of psychedelic rock
                        invokes three core effects of LSD: depersonalization, dechronicization, and dynamization, all of
                        which detach the user from reality.[2] Musically, the effects may be represented via novelty
                        studio tricks, electronic or non-Western instrumentation, disjunctive song structures, and
                        extended instrumental segments.[3] Some of the earlier 1960s psychedelic rock musicians were
                        based in folk, jazz, and the blues, while others showcased an explicit Indian classical
                        influence called "raga rock". In the 1960s, there existed two main variants of the genre: the
                        more whimsical, surrealist British psychedelia and the harder American West Coast acid rock.
                        While "acid rock" is sometimes deployed interchangeably with the term "psychedelic rock", it
                        also refers more specifically to the heavier and more extreme ends of the genre.</p>

                    <p>The peak years of psychedelic rock were between 1967 and 1969, with milestone events including
                        the 1967 Summer of Love and the 1969 Woodstock Rock Festival, becoming an international musical
                        movement associated with a widespread counterculture before beginning a decline as changing
                        attitudes, the loss of some key individuals, and a back-to-basics movement led surviving
                        performers to move into new musical areas. The genre bridged the transition from early blues and
                        folk-based rock to progressive rock and hard rock, and as a result contributed to the
                        development of sub-genres such as heavy metal. Since the late 1970s it has been revived in
                        various forms of neo-psychedelia.</p>
