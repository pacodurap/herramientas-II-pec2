In the 1960s, there existed two main variants of the genre: the\n                        more whimsical, surrealist British psychedelia and the harder American West Coast acid rock.\n                        While \"acid rock\" is sometimes deployed interchangeably with the term \"psychedelic rock\", it\n                        also refers more specifically to the heavier and more extreme ends of the genre.</p>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"col-sm-6\"><img src=\"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/0719-FEA-BHR-L-altin.jpg\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"Altin Gun\"></div>\n\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"container-md my-5\">\n            <div class=\"row\">\n                <div class=\"col-sm-6\"><img src=\"https://www.mondosonoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/holy_wave.jpg\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"Holy Wave\"></div>\n                <div class=\"col-sm-6\">\n                    <p>The peak years of psychedelic rock were between 1967 and 1969, with milestone events including\n                        the 1967 Summer of Love and the 1969 Woodstock Rock Festival, becoming an international musical\n                        movement associated with a widespread counterculture before beginning a decline as changing\n                        attitudes, the loss of some key individuals, and a back-to-basics movement led surviving\n                        performers to move into new musical areas. The genre bridged the transition from early blues and\n                        folk-based rock to progressive rock and hard rock, and as a result contributed to the\n                        development of sub-genres such as heavy metal. Since the late 1970s it has been revived in\n                        various forms of neo-psychedelia.</p>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n\n    </section>\n</main>\n\n<footer>\n    <a href=\"/eacf331f0ffc35d4b482f1d15a887d3b.html\">\n        <h1 class=\"logo\">tripifest</h1>\n    </a>\n    <nav>\n        <a href=\"/eacf331f0ffc35d4b482f1d15a887d3b.html\">Front page</a>\n        <a href=\"/d482b16a9b838466ee413e9365818d48.html\">Bands</a>\n        <a href=\"/916493bde0b0ce638dca619c2e1de937.html\">Info</a>\n        <a href=\"#\">Other</a>\n    </nav>\n    <div>\n        <i class=\"fab fa-facebook-f\"></i>\n        <i class=\"fab fa-twitter\"></i>\n        <i class=\"fab fa-instagram\"></i>\n    </div>\n</footer>\n\n<script src=\"/ef87f1a51abc11aa7067a8d1df924a13.js\"></script><!-- do not remove this line! -->\n\n\n</html>"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"69e973034927a107528c1915337e5a0e","cacheData":{}}
